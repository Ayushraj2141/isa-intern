Data driven Astronomy
what is data 
survey data || in depth study of data 
james web -- observatory mode data -- details about james web and data interpretation
gaia telescope -- survey mode data | periodic data release
survey mode always available 
observatory -- some data is always available
archival data -- available of data for everyone || best quality of data 
propritery data -- only mine not  shared like we do research for sometime and after that it is available for everyone to work on 
ESO-Vista / LSST -- what are they
data centers -- jaha pr woh data ki research hoti haiii
python jupyter notebooks and mysql talks

kind of data 
-- images(just a multidimensional matrix with colors as element all the operations could be done just like a matrix )
|| data cubes -- point sources(stars except sun) || extended object(galaxies - array of brightness)
---- x-y array | pixels | rgb images based on the wavelenghts 
-- catalogs - tabular data 
-- spectra - intensuty vs wavelenth 
-- time series - variable sources 
-- polarization - magnetic fields 
what are ccds and its working ?? how was image stores in these 
-- colors : bayer filter what are these -- how is colored stoed in them ?? what are these filters 
50 percent green and 25 percent blue and red each -- used in digital cameras? 
different types of telescope and what are the difference in taking a photo of same object like what are the differences overall
FITS(flexible image transport images) format to store Astronomy data specifically - contains all the things of image data intercepts etc etc 
brightness could be done by scaling -- linear scaling or square scaling or root scaling -- ways of enhancing image to look good 

spitzer telescope || xray chandra image and types of telescope ?? based on light spectra
combined images 

spectra are like fingerints || signature -- we get the spectra of object we could easily get the chemical combination
like we studied in atomic structure || velocity of source using doplers shift || thermal broadning 
why do telescopes has large lenses 

data cubes -- 3d data || IFS(integral field spectroscopy)
catalog data -- in form of rows and table generally using gaiya data 
time series data -- like looking for an exoplanet data we could figure it out using variation in different fields in different time
ds9 || (TOPCAT)  || programming languages -- python ,,, libraries , modules etc 
meta data - descriptive information of data 

astronomy archives -- hipparchus ||  tycho brahe data was used by kepler to derive his studies 

earliest archival data set was from palomar sky survey -- in california USA 
-- 2000 photographic plates which were later digitialised which kept improving with date 
(citizen science projects ( SETI || GALAXY ZOO ) -- non scientists could contribute kinda like github )
ek baar study ccds in a bit detail it seems fun tbh
some sites to visit archival data -- VizieR , Simbad , NED , ESO ,  Hubble MAST , IPAC/ISRA , 2dFGRS
