1st Lecture -- Astronomy and Astrophysics : as Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
Astronomy is the oldest known science -- Heart Nebula We could build a story using a picture
learn about some basic termenologies 
Astronomy in todays time -- CCD , GPS , Solar panels , CAT scans -- its research
gave many byproducts measuring distances -- story of William Herschel and
Charles Messier crab nebula , from distance we could find how big it is actually
it helps to tell us what we are seeing is a galaxy , a star , a moon or what , a
cluster -- a sun and the moon looks the same size from earth Millenium
sumulation -- a cosmic web whats this -- light takes time to travel too -- speed
= distance/time light travels 1 m in 3 nanoseconds light year , parsec , AU ( if
sun vanishes we would'nt know it for 8 minutes ) -- if a galaxy is 150 light
years awaay we are seeing the light of 150,000 old of that galaxy -- like we
don't know if that galaxy exists in this timeline or not nearest cluster of
galaxy is about 65 million light years away - M87 (,M51) black hole -- what we are
seeing is the light from that black hole when dinosaurs were killed on earth
Cosmic Eye -- a state of art view of the universe -- powers of 10 in the
universe -- naked eye astronomy -- how to view sky at night -- the visible sky
we use angles to measuree things -- angular distance , radians (small angle
formula) for rough measure -- palm 10 degree , finger 1 degree and in lenghth --
3,4,6 respectively celestial sphere , disc ,equator -- imaginary , latitudes and
longitudes - prime meridian , tropic of cancer , tropic of capricon and other
basic geographical basics earth centric co-ordinates , Zeinith (and Nadar) horizan , circle
and great circle All through the night -- always pay attention to all the
details - try to ask question from everystatement you will learn a lot by this
From looking at the stars we could easily tell where are we standing right now
there is a proof too which you could check -- what if you get kidnapped in north
-- star trail would be about the north star -- at south and north angles are 90
what are those lights on poles -- see it the star trails would be different on
different locations whether it be on poles , equators(semi-circular) or at any
other location some part never rise and set if we are on poles -- there is chunk
of sky which we would never see if we don't travel because northern hemisphere
people would not see southern hemisphere stars

Day - 2
latitude and longitude for a star 
<!-- Right ascension and declination -->
# Important dates in a year as related to astronomy
each hour is almost 15 degrees  , celestial co-ordinates of star vega for reference 
-- The sun's daily path across the sky 
mar 21 and sept 21 -- only two days when it start from east and set at west 
rest days different 
biggest mythbusters that are false which we assume in day-to-day life
sun's motion based on ouur location 
what are solistices and equinoxes
Relative motion in universe?
in southern hemis our head is flipped -- daamn it means everything is flipped that side 
orbit of earth and its behavior - seasons , day and night etc etc 
tilt of earth -- not because its closest to sun -- effect of inclination 
-- perihilion and aphelion -- 4 jan and 4 june
how we came to know the shape of the earth ?
list of major constellations 
ecliptic cast -- zodiac about this line -- nakshatras all have some degrees check that 
we could find soo many things using constellations -- astrology all came from this 
precessing -- earth conical rotation -- effect of moon -- two body system 
relative positionioning of earth and sun is changing 18000 later vega will be pole star which now is polarasis -- for a long time there will be no pole start
